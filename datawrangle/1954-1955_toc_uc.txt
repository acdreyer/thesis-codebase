INDEX DF NACA TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS 



June, 1954 - May, 1955 




WASHINGTON - 1955 



PREFACE 



This Index of NACA Technical Publications covers those 
NACA research reports issued in the period of June 1954 
through May 1955. It is the fourth supplement to the basic 
1915-1949 Index. 

The research reports issued prior to June 1954 which have 
been declassified since that date have also been included. 
In addition, current announcement of newly declassified ma- 
terials is regularly made in the NACA Research Abstracts . 

The arrangement of the present Index follows that of its 
predecessors: (1) A classified listing of the subject cate- 
gories, (2) a chronological listing of the NACA research re- 
ports under each subject category, (3) an alphabetical index 
to the subject categories, and (4) an author index. An Ex- 
planatory Chart on page iii maybe helpful in identifying ref- 
erences to NACA research reports encountered in the liter- 
ature. 

Entries included herein duplicate in part the information 
of the index cards furnished with the individual research re- 
ports. Recipients maintaining card files may care to dis- 
card those index cards on hand for unclassified research 
reports issued during the June 1954 - May 1955 period. 

Newly available research reports are currently announced 
in the NACA Research Abstracts and are normally available 
for a period of five years after announcement. Older re- 
search reports (those issued prior to May 1950) are thus 
available on a "loan only" basis within the United States. 
Requests for NACA research reports should be forwarded 
to the address given below.
